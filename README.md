# jade-news
News Aggregator inspired by [news.routley.io](github.com/jamesroutley/news.routley.io).

## Future
Add state tracking file of links, age links out of tracking file,
so we gracefully handle articles that get fall off the end of source feed before our expiration

Can we do this on a branch instead of docs folder? what does that look like?
why? keeps commit noise out of trunk
